# Kepler Objects of Interest

Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) are habitable Earth-like planets. 

## Purpose of This Project

The purpose of creating this project was to demonstrate machine-learning topics and models for UCSB's PSTAT 131 course, Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning, taught by Dr. Katie Coburn.

This may be useful because there are more than 9,000 potential exoplanets in NASA's data base. To be able to accurately separate KOIs as candidates, confirmed, or false positives for the purpose of diverting more attention and resources to planets that are more promising will greatly save researchers time.

## File for Viewing Report

Please download ```final.html``` to view the polished report. You should be able to read and understand the methods with ease. But to condense the format of the report, the contents are the following:

- Introduction: Explains KOI and why the report is useful. Additionally, there is some required data wrangling and clean up.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: This section features some data exploration.
- Pre-Model Set-up: Creation of recipe, as well as training/testing data splits and K-fold cross validation set-up.
- PCA: This section was not as fleshed out, due to a lack of necessity and appropriateness for PCA due to the loss of interpretability, but was included for demonstration.
- Models: All models used were K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Boosted Trees, Random Forests. Use of parameter tuning with the help of cross-validation. Most workflows used were inspired by a popular Tidymodels framework.
- Best Model: Additional Exploration of the best model and other metrics to test.
- Conclusion.

## Contributions

I am open to contributions and the use of the results to explore other questions that may arise from this report. Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
